Completed JPMorgan Chase &amp; Coâ€™s Software Engineering Virtual Experience on Forage, where I developed backend services with Java Spring, REST APIs, and integrated Kafka for messaging and H2 for database testing. Gained skills in API development, SQL, and project setup with Maven. Excited to bring these skills to real-world projects!
