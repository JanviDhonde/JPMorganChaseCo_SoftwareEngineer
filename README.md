## JPMorgan Chase & Co Software Engineering Job Simulation
**JPMorganChaseCo_SoftwareEngineer:** <br>
Completed JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co’s Software Engineering Virtual Experience on Forage, where I developed backend services with Java Spring, REST APIs, and integrated Kafka for messaging and H2 for database testing. Gained skills in API development, SQL, and project setup with Maven. Excited to bring these skills to real-world projects!

**Repository Overview:**  
This repository documents my experience in the **JPMorgan Chase & Co Software Engineering Virtual Experience** on Forage. In this simulation, I took on the role of a software engineer working on developing a backend service using **Java Spring** and **REST APIs**, and integrated tools like **Kafka** for messaging and **H2** as an in-memory database. 

**Simulation Highlights:**

1. **Project Setup**  
   - Created a structured project environment with **Maven** for dependency management, setting the foundation for scalable development.

2. **Kafka Integration**  
   - Integrated **Apache Kafka** to enable efficient message passing between services, enhancing the application's ability to handle large volumes of real-time data.

3. **H2 Integration**  
   - Set up an **H2** in-memory database, useful for rapid testing and development without needing a fully-fledged database service.

4. **REST API Integration**  
   - Developed and deployed **RESTful APIs** to handle client requests, adhering to REST principles for efficient and reliable service design.
  
5. **REST API Controller**  
   - Designed and implemented **REST API Controllers** using **Spring Boot**, defining endpoints for core functionalities and ensuring data consistency and error handling.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- **Spring Framework**: Leveraged **Spring** and **Spring Boot** to develop a scalable and maintainable backend service.
- **Java Development**: Enhanced my knowledge of **Java** for building robust server-side applications.
- **Kafka**: Implemented **Kafka** for messaging, enabling efficient communication within a microservices environment.
- **Maven**: Managed dependencies using **Maven**, ensuring smooth project configuration and version control.
- **SQL with H2**: Utilized **SQL** within the **H2** in-memory database for quick and effective data management.

**Skills Developed:**
- **Backend Development**: Strengthened my ability to build backend applications using **Java** and **Spring**, focusing on REST API development.
- **Messaging Systems**: Gained practical experience with **Kafka** for real-time message handling in distributed systems.
- **Database Integration**: Enhanced skills in integrating lightweight databases like **H2** for fast development and testing cycles.
- **RESTful Design**: Applied REST API design principles, improving the efficiency and scalability of backend services.
- **Project Configuration with Maven**: Gained confidence in project setup and dependency management using **Maven**.

**Objective:**  
This repository showcases my work during JPMorgan Chase & Co’s **Software Engineering Job Simulation** on Forage, where I applied **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **Kafka**, and **REST API** principles to create and manage backend services. This experience reinforced my passion for backend engineering and the importance of scalable, efficient design in high-volume applications. I look forward to applying the skills I've gained on a software engineering team at a company like JPMorgan Chase & Co.
